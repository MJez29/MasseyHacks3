## Machine Learning with Python

Python is a fairly easy language to pick up and is oftentimes a good first language.

In case you don't have Python, you can download version 3.6.1 from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Dependencies

#### Windows

You may need to run your command line as an administrator. Run:

`python -m pip install numpy`

`python -m pip install scipy`

`python -m pip install scikit-learn`

#### MacOS

Open terminal and run:

`sudo pip install numpy`

`sudo pip install scipy`

`sudo pip install scikit-learn`

---

#### Test Dependencies

Run a python shell in the command line or open IDLE and run:

`import sklearn`

If it doesn't throw an error, you're good to go.
